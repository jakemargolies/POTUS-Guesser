The POTUS-Guesser project is a simple game with a text-based console user interface written using Python 3.

The purpose of this project is two-fold:
1. To provide a good excuse for practicing the implementation of ANSI-based terminal user interfaces, which I am finding increasingly useful in the types of applications I am writing.
2. To help me memorize the names and order of U.S. Presidents, thus satisfying my thirst for useless knowledge. 

Dedicated to my Dad who, like me, will still prefer Sporcle.
